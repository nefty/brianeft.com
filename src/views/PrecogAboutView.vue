    <h1>ESP</h1>
    <p>
      ESP, or extrasensory perception, is the claimed ability to perceive
      information with the mind outside of the ordinary physical senses. This
      app is inpired by the
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/esp-trainer/id336882103"
        >ESP Trainer app</a
      >
      developed by Russel Targ at Stanford Research Institute. Here is
      <a href="https://www.espresearch.com/iphone/"
        >a quote from his website describing the app</a
      >.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “The ESP trainer was developed under a NASA program by Russell Targ at
        Stanford Research Institute.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have found that people are able to improve their ESP scores by using
        a machine just like this and get in touch with the part of themselves
        that is psychic. This is often called a clairvoyant ability, and can
        enhance your life in many surprising ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player is presented with four colored squares. For each trial, one
        has been selected at random by the ESP Trainer. Your task is to choose
        the correct square.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you succeed, you will hear a chime, feel a vibration, and see a large
        color picture. Otherwise, the system lights up the correct square, and
        you proceed with the next trial. The score indicator at the top counts
        the number of correct choices. Words of encouragement appear as you
        achieve the scoring levels of 6, 8. 10, 12 or 14 hits. After 24 trials
        you may begin a new game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game offers multi-sensory feedback, reinforcement, and an
        opportunity to Pass, meeting all the requirements needed for learning
        this skill. ESP Trainer improves your ability to recognize your
        intuitive impressions, and it can bring you to a level of intuitive
        awareness beyond anything you've experienced before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the trainer is to allow you to become aware of what it
        feels like when you psychically choose the correct square. When you
        don't have that special feeling, we encourage you to press the Pass
        button. (So this is not a "forced choice" test.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In a year long NASA program with 145 subjects (under Contract 953653
        NAS7-100) many were able to significantly improve their scores. Four of
        the subjects improved their scores at the hundred-to-one level or
        better. This approach has been used with surprising success on Wall
        Street. But of course, past results are no guarantee of future
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>Because you are learning a new skill, slower is better than faster.</p>
      <p>
        If you find yourself frequently scoring 12 or more, write to the
        developer: Contact Russell Targ

      <p>
        This game can provide the first steps toward experiencing and developing
        the psychic abilities hidden within us all.”
